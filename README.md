## General Optimisation

Let's get started with optimising the launcher first!
### Launcher settings

- Ensure you are using the correct version of Java for your Minecraft version.

|              Minecraft Version               | Recommended Java Version |
| :------------------------------------------: | :----------------------: |
| [1.8,1.9,1.10,1.11,1.12,1.13,1.14,1.15,1.16] |         Java 1.8         |
|         [1.17,1.18,1.19,1.20-1.20.4]         |         Java 17          |
|             [1.20.5-1.20.6,1.21]             |         Java 21          |
- Use the **HOLY GL4ES** renderer as it's pretty fast and supports all Minecraft versions.
- Use the following table to allocate ram for the game.

| 4 GB            | 800 MB                 | 1200 MB                      |
| 6 GB            | 1000 MB                | 1600 MB                      |
